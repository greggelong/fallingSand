# fallingSand
a place to play with falling sand simulations in processing, p5 and python

I am using some ideas and logic from this great blog.

 https://blog.winter.dev/2020/falling-sand-games/
 
However I am implementing like 'game of life'  using two arrays grid[][] and nextGrid[][]

having some trouble with the logic of sand falling through water 

use the drag and press the mouse while holding 

- 's' to drop sand

- 'w' to drop water

- 'x' to destroy


I would like to add some living growing plants

and some stones in the air
